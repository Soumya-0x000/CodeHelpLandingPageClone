===============================CodeHelp Landing Page Clone===============================

This project is a cloned version of the CodeHelp landing page with some exciting changes and a redesigned sidebar. The updated design is not only visually appealing but also responsive, making it more user-friendly on mobile and medium-sized screens. In addition to the design changes, we've also added a login page and a registration page to enhance the user experience.

[Key Changes and Features]

1. ___Redesigned Sidebar___

We've given the sidebar a fresh and modern look to improve the navigation and aesthetics. The redesigned sidebar is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Now, it's more convenient to explore the content on mobile devices and medium-sized screens.

3. ___Login Page___

To enhance user interaction, we've included a dedicated login page. Users can access their accounts easily with their credentials, improving the overall user experience and providing a sense of personalization.

4. ___Registration Page___

In addition to the login page, we've introduced a registration page to allow new users to sign up for an account. This addition makes it a one-stop solution for both existing and new users, catering to a broader audience.

5. ___Responsive Design___

The entire landing page, sidebar, login page, and registration page are designed to be responsive. Whether you're accessing the site on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the user experience remains consistent and visually appealing.

6. ___Scroll to Top Button___

We've also added a convenient "scroll to top" button that appears when you start scrolling down the page. This button allows you to quickly return to the top of the page, making the navigation experience even more user-friendly.
